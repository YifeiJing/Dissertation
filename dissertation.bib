abstract = {A simple probabilistic method has been developed to predict the ability of energy storage to increase the penetration of intermittent embedded renewable generation (ERG) on weak elec- tricity grids and to enhance the value of the electricity generated by time-shifting delivery to the network. This paper focuses on the connection of wind generators at locations where the level of ERG would be limited by the voltage rise. Short-term storage, covering less than 1 h, offers only a small increase in the amount of elec- tricity that can be absorbed by the network. Storage over periods of up to one day delivers greater energy benefits, but is significantly more expensive. Different feasible electricity storage technologies are compared for their operational suitability over different time scales. The value of storage in relation to power rating and energy capacity has been investigated so as to facilitate appropriate sizing.},

abstract = {The current electric grid is an inefficient system that wastes significant amounts of the electricity it produces because there is a disconnect between the amount of energy consumers require and the amount of energy produced from generation sources. Power plants typically produce more power than necessary to ensure adequate power quality. By taking advantage of energy storage within the grid, many of these inefficiencies can be removed. When using battery energy storage systems (BESS) for grid storage, advanced modeling is required to accurately monitor and control the storage system. A battery management system (BMS) controls how the storage system will be used and a BMS that utilizes advanced physics-based models will offer for much more robust operation of the storage system. The paper outlines the current state of the art for modeling in BMS and the advanced models required to fully utilize BMS for both lithium-ion batteries and vanadium redox-flow batteries. In addition, system architecture and how it can be useful in monitoring and control is discussed. A pathway for advancing BMS to better utilize BESS for grid-scale applications is outlined. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and information portals enable customers to have access to real-time electricity pricing information, thus facilitating customer participation in demand response. The objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates on customer behaviors in a residential community. Research findings indicate that the TOU rate can be properly designed to reduce the peak demand even when PHEVs are present. This result is insensitive to seasons, PHEV penetration levels and PHEV charging strategies. It is expected that this paper can give policy makers, electric utilities and other relevant stakeholders an insight into the impacts of various TOU pricing schemes on distribution load shapes in a smart grid with PHEV penetration. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for modeling and analyzing the load demand in a distribution system due to electric vehicle (EV) battery charging. Following a brief introduction to the common types of EV batteries and their charging characteristics, an analytical solution for predicting the EV charging load is developed. The method is stochastically formulated so as to account for the stochastic nature of the start time of individual battery charging and the initial battery state-of-charge. A comparative study is carried out by simulating four EV charging scenarios, i.e., uncontrolled domestic charging, uncontrolled off-peak domestic charging, smart domestic charging and uncontrolled public chargingcommuters capable of recharging at the workplace. The proposed four EVs charging scenarios take into account the expected future changes to the electricity tariffs in the electricity market place and appropriate regulation of EVs battery charging loads. A typical U.K. distribution system is adopted as an example. The time-series data of EV charging loads is taken from two commercially available EV batteries: lead-acid and lithium-ion. Results show that a 10{\%} market penetration of EVs in the studied system would result in an increase in daily peak demand by up to 17.9{\%}, while a 20{\%} level of EV penetration would lead to a 35.8{\%} increase in peak load, for the scenario of uncontrolled domestic chargingthe worst-case scenario. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

In the near future, the number of plug-in electric vehicles will likely grow significantly in the world. Despite the aforementioned advantages, the connection of PEV to the power grid poses a series of new challenges for electric utilities. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for evaluating the impact of different levels of PEV penetration on distribution network investment and incremental energy losses. The proposed approach is based on the use of a large-scale distribution planning model which is used to analyze two real distribution areas. Obtained results show that depending on the charging strategies, investment costs can increase up to 15{\%} of total actual distribution network investment costs, and energy losses can increase up to 40{\%} in off-peak hours for a scenario with 60{\%} of total vehicles being PEV. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The properties of the Weibull distribution function are used to show that there are some simple relationships between the Weibull parameters (k, c) and the wind speed moments $(\bar v,\,\overline {{v^3}} )$. In particular, to within 1%, v̄ = 1/2π1/2c (for 1.6 ≤ k ≤ 3.0) and $\,\overline {{v^3}} = \,1/2{\pi ^{1/2}}(3{c^3}/k)$ (for 1.8 ≤ k 2.3). These results are subsequently used to examine the relationship between seasonal, yearly and many-yearly Weibull parameters for a given site. Some simple 'sum-rules' are derived which conserve the time-averaged moments v̄ and $\,\overline {{v^3}} $. These sum rules are used, in turn, to suggest a 'generalised Weibull distribution function' which can be used to model the fluctuations, which will occur from year to year, in the average moments v̄ and $\,\overline {{v^3}} $. In addition, some new results for Lord Howe Island are presented, which show that the annual wind speed, at selected sites, is ~8.1 ms⁻¹. These results are used to discuss the problem of determining the Weibull parameters (k, c) from experiment. It is shown that the 'maximum-likeness' and 'moments' methods are superior to the 'ℓnℓn linear least squares' method. Finally some comments are also made concerning the choice of distribution function to model wind speed statistics. Using Pearson's method of moments, it is shown that a Pearson distribution function type IB could be used to model the Lord Howe island wind data, in preference to the Weibull distribution function. However the former is rejected on the grounds that the use of three parameters to model the wind speed statistics does not lead to any significant improvement over the two parameter Weibull distribution function.},

abstract = {Economics and environmental incentives, as well as advances in technology, are reshaping the traditional view of industrial systems. The anticipation of a large penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into the market brings up many technical problems that are highly related to industrial information technologies within the next ten years. There is a need for an in-depth understanding of the electrification of transportation in the industrial environment. It is important to consolidate the practical and the conceptual knowledge of industrial informatics in order to support the emerging electric vehicle (EV) technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the electrification of transportation in an industrial environment. In addition, it provides a comprehensive survey of the EVs in the field of industrial informatics systems, namely: 1) charging infrastructure and PHEV/PEV batteries; 2) intelligent energy management; 3) vehicle-to-grid; and 4) communication requirements. Moreover, this paper presents a future perspective of industrial information technologies to accelerate the market introduction and penetration of advanced electric drive vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

@article{paper:evlimitation,
abstract = {The anticipation of a large penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the market brings up many technical problems that need to be addressed. In the near future, a large number of PHEVs in our society will add a large-scale energy load to our power grids, as well as add substantial energy resources that can be utilized. An emerging issue is that a large number of PHEVs simultaneously connected to the grid may pose a huge threat to the overall power system quality and stability. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (e.g., 3000) charging at a municipal parking station. The authors used the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to intelligently allocate electrical energy to the PHEVs connected to the grid. A mathematical framework for the objective function (i.e., maximizing the average state-of-charge at the next time step) is also given. The authors considered real-world constraints such as energy price, remaining battery capacity, and remaining charging time. The authors also simulated the real-world parking deck scenarios according to the statistical analysis based on the transportation data. The authors characterized the performance of EDA using a Matlab simulation, and compared it with other optimization techniques. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are becoming more popular in smart grids. The batteries of these electric vehicles may be charged at home from a standard outlet. These extra electrical loads may have several adverse impacts on the distribution system. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for evaluating the adverse impact of different levels of PHEV penetration on the loss of distribution transformers' life. The proposed method is applied to a sample distribution transformer supplying residential customers. Obtained results show that nighttime charging of PHEVs has the least adverse impact on the loss of transformers' life. This is while charging during evening peak hours can even cause a 900{\%} increase in the transformer loss-of-life rate for a scenario with only 30{\%} penetration of PHEVs.},
